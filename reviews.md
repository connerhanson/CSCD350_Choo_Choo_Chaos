# Hill Climb Racing Reviews #
### Review 1: ###
"It doesn't make sense. You upgrade your vehicle and it still barley climbs hills, but if you barley hit the back button he launches backwards like a rocket, so you'll hit forward then he goes zipping forward like nothing does a flip and it's over, but can't climb a hill. Can do a flip because it's got so much power it can't stay on the ground, but when you get control of the vehicle it can't climb a hill. Seems like the game sets you up for failure. Very boring and expensive. üëé"

"Okay game. After playing a lot, it gets super tedious with every course having 90 degree slopes all the time. Upgrades take a long time unless you wanna cheese with moon or buy coins. Not worth the endless slog"

"It's a good game, but there's a problem with the ads. There's no X appearing in the edge of the screen, so every 3 rounds I have to restart the game and my coins etc from the last round are gone. Not to mention there's way too much ads in general."

"Really fun game, but there is a bug I have recently come across. Fully upgraded the super off-roader and now the physics change part way into the track where it starts behaving as if I'm on the moon. Makes it very difficult to make money now to buy a new vehicle or level but it is every level that it does this. Disappointing"

## Conclusion: ##
Overall, people seem to enjoy the game but have issues with the ads, progression system, and the feel of accelerating and reversing. We will address these issues by having no ads, sensible progression, and smooth accelerating and reversing. People seem to like the simplicity of the game and UI and the variety of levels.

# User Stories #
### As a player, I want: ###
* to be able to consistantly purchase upgrades for my choo choo train without a crazy grind.
* to feel in control when I'm accelerating, braking, reversing, or otherwise controlling my choo choo train.
* to play the game without being interrupted by ads.
* the UI to be easily traversable and intuitively understandable, even if I am not familiar with mobile game formats.
* the gameplay to be visually stimulating and have a helpful HUD for my collectibles, resources, etc.

These are all non-functional requirements idk what functional requirements we should have

# Considerations #
### What functions does the system perform? ###
The system will have the game and a menu with an upgrade system for the train
### What functions do the ‚Äúactors‚Äù require? ###
The "actors" need to be able to upgrade their train and be able to accelerate, decelerate, and reverse
### What input/output does the system need? ###
The system needs touch input from the user and will output graphics to the user
